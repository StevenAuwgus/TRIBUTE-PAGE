He escaped with few injuries, and while both of the others recieved serious wounds, they all survived.</li>
                
                <li><span class="year">1977:</span>Bob was diagnosed with melanoma in his toe. Though doctors recommended he amputate his entire leg, he followed the advice of his family and friends and only removed the infected part of the toe.</li>
